Helpful Tip: You don't need to create a file to start writing. Simply use any of the additive data
manipulation commands ['e', 'aa', 'ab'], and a new document will automatically be created. To save,
you will still have to provide a filename.

o xxxxx - Open a file named “xxxxx”.
c       - Save the current loaded data to the originating file.
s xxxxx - Save the current loaded data to a new file, with filename xxxxx. The filename entered can
          have the file extension .txt or .csv. Default is .txt if no valid extension is provided.
p       - Print the contents of the document.
e xxxxx - Edits the current-line, using the current cursor position, and inserts the string “xxxxx”.
rm      - Removes the character to the left of the cursor.
rm x    - Removes x characters to the left of the cursor.
r       - Move right one character.
r x     - Move right x characters.
l       - Move left one character.
l x     - Move left x characters.
d       - Move down one line, preserving the cursor position, not adding any new lines.
d x     - Move down x lines, preserving the cursor position, not adding any new lines.
u       - Move up one line, preserving the cursor position, not adding any new lines.
u x     - Move up one line, preserving the cursor position, not adding any new lines.
q       - Exit the program, without saving any data.
ab      - Add a blank line below the current-line.
aa      - Add a blank line above the current-line.
dl      - Delete the current-line.
dl x    - Delete the current-line, and x - 1 lines below. If there are only less than x lines
          available, only remove those lines.
cl      - Clear the currently loaded data from the program.
